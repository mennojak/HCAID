# Artery Alert: Heart Disease Classification AI Application
**Description:**

This repository hosts an AI-powered web application developed as part of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) minor course assignment, which has been made in collaboration with another student. The project involves the creation of two machine learning applications, both trained on the same [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) but with contrasting ethical approaches. 

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate the stark difference between an ethically responsible AI application and one that prioritizes profit over ethical considerations. Both applications are designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on user-provided health information.

**Key Features:**

- Good App: This ethical AI application offers responsible health predictions, prioritizing user well-being. It provides accurate risk assessments, transparent recommendations, and access to healthcare resources without compromising user privacy.

- Bad App: In contrast, this unethical AI application prioritizes profit. It promotes supplements for revenue and exploits user data, inundating users with advertisements and spam, all while providing misleading health advice.

**Technology Stack:**

- Django: The web application is built using Django, a Python-based web framework known for its simplicity and robustness.
- Jupyter Notebook: The pre-trained machine learning model was trained with jupyter notebook (the original notebook is also found in the repository).
- PythonAnywhere Hosting: The application is temporarily hosted on the PythonAnywhere platform to meet assignment criteria.

**Usage:**

The ethical and unethical AI applications can be temporarily accessed online for testing and demonstration purposes. Simply visit the following [URL](https://mennojak.pythonanywhere.com/) (please note that the URL may stop working, since I'll probably stop hosting it when the course assignment is completed).

**Disclaimer:**

This project is solely for educational and demonstrative purposes, highlighting the importance of ethical considerations in AI development.
